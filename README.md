# Marvel Snap Keyboard Adapter
The Marvel Snap Keyboard Adapter is a Python repository containing a project aimed at adapting the controls of a game called Marvel Snap for keyboard input. This project is currently under development and is designed to work specifically with a screen resolution of 1900 by 1200 pixels.

## Description
The goal of this adaptation project is to provide players with an alternative input method for Marvel Snap, enabling them to play the game using a keyboard instead of the default controller (mouse). By leveraging the Python programming language and its libraries, the project aims to enhance the accessibility and convenience of the game for a wider range of players.

The repository houses the necessary Python scripts, modules, and resources required to implement the keyboard adapter. Allowing players to perform actions such as movement and interactions within the Marvel Snap game battles.

While the project is still in progress, the initial implementation supports the screen resolution of 1900 by 1200 pixels. Development efforts are focused on ensuring compatibility with different resolutions and aspect ratios. Future updates may expand the project to support additional screen resolutions commonly used by players.

Contributions from the open-source community are welcomed and encouraged. Developers can actively participate in improving the keyboard adapter project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or even contributing code to enhance its functionality and compatibility.

With the Marvel Snap Keyboard Adapter project, players will have the freedom to enjoy the game using a keyboard, providing a versatile and accessible alternative to traditional control schemes.
